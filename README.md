# PolicyPal
PolicyPal is a demo chatbot experience to redefine the way users engage with insurance. Say goodbye to complicated forms and confusing jargon â€“ with PolicyPal, obtaining insurance information becomes as easy as having a conversation. This demo utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on an open-source [insurance Q&A corpus](https://github.com/shuzi/insuranceQA/tree/master) with real-world user questions on various insurance domains.

## Tech Stack
In this Google Collab notebook, a RAG pipeline in Python is implemented using OpenAI's LLM in combination with a Weaviate vector database and an OpenAI embedding model. LangChain is used for orchestration with Gradio's ChatBot module used as a simple web user interface.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following before continuing:

- **OpenAI API key**: We will generate embeddings from text via OpenAI's inference service. The Ada model (version 2) costs $0.0001 per 1,000 tokens. For this demo, the embedding of a subset of the InsuranceCorpus was $0.23.
- **Weaviate API key and cluster URL**: Run a Weaviate instance as a managed service using Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS). The free trial plan provides a sandbox for 14 days. No payment information is required. The sandbox expires after the trial period but a new free trial sandbox can be created anytime. Refer to the Setup section in this article for more information.
